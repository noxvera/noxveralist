# noxvera List
This is the repository for the noxvera List, a website created to list and document all of my maps, as most of them are never released. <br>
You can also submit records, but many maps are near-impossible.

Special thanks to <a href="https://github.com/TheShittyList" rel="noopener">TSL</a> for the template.
