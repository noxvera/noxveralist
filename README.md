# noxvera List
This is a website created to list and document all of my levels,
since most (~90%) of my levels are never released or even showcased. <br>
You can also submit records, but it isn't the main focus of the website (and
many of my levels are near-impossible anyways).

Special thanks to <a href="https://github.com/TheShittyList" rel="noopener">TSL</a> 
for the template this website is based on.

## Website is in active development
