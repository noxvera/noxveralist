The initial idea was to respond to one of those “build your own strigbtfly” maps by just making a penis but after @noxvera showed me that you could like paste copied elements into the level with mega hack I pasted a bunch of elements from silent club step into the map (hence the name silent club challenge). I have no idea what the context for the song is I think it was just a funny song chosen at random.\"",
